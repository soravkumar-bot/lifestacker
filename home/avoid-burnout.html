  <h1>How to Avoid Burnout in a Busy Lifestyle</h1>
  <p>
    Burnout does not happen overnight. It builds slowly through constant pressure,
    lack of rest, and unrealistic expectations. Understanding the warning signs early
    allows you to reset before exhaustion takes control.

  <h2>Early Warning Signs</h2>
  <p>
    Fatigue, irritability, loss of motivation, and reduced concentration are common
    indicators that your energy system is overloaded.

  <h2>Why Burnout Is So Common Today</h2>
  <p>
    Always-on work culture and constant digital connectivity leave very little room
    for mental recovery. Without intentional boundaries, stress becomes your default state.

  <h2>Recovery Without Guilt</h2>
  <p>
    Rest is not a reward for finishing everything — it is a requirement for sustainable productivity.
    Schedule downtime the same way you schedule work.
  </p>

  <h2>Long-Term Energy Protection</h2>
  <p>
    Burnout prevention is not about escape. It is about building a lifestyle that supports
    your physical, emotional and mental energy over time.
